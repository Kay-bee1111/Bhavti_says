Oh darling,\nIt'll always be obscured.\n\nSo you'll stop working?\nHa, look at your guilt.\nGo do it all anyways,\nregret is ensured...\n\nSome might know your endeavors,\nBut you'll always be obscured."

        "content": "Maybe I did build up the walls too high,\nAnd perhaps forgot the door\nThought I'd be better off on my own\nWhy the hell was I so sure?\n\nIt took wars and battles,\nSurvival, suffering and every wound...\n\nOh after ages and eternities,\nMy heart is safe and sound...\n\nHere in my throne, alone I sit...\nDo I regret it? Not even a bit!\n\nI have my lovely flowers, oh I remember their lovely scent...\nRemember? Well yeah they're in a far off land.\n\nI keep pictures of them on my favourite wall,\nOh God I love them, I love them all.\nI cherish their scent, and I see them often,\nWhen I'm ready for the war that leads to them.\n\nAnd next on my wall, you see that lovely cottage,\nThe home of mine I'll move to as I age.\nThe warmth, the comfort I go there time to time,\nWhen I've won the fortune and blessings that let me call it mine.\n\nOh boy how I dream of the warmth and the scents,\nBut alas they're both at very opposite ends\n\nAnd here I'm in my tower at altitude,\nSafely sulking in solitude\nFar from my flowers, nowhere close to my cottage,\nHoping I won't be yearning for a hug at every age."

And then\nScared the monster out.\n\nThe moment she exhaled,\nThe fears she had held so tight,\nThat was when the princess,\nBecame her own knight.\n\n"
